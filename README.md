# Nävî BRuAdmin

<code>Nävî is version 2 of my personal assistant (Omni) built soley for my own use and convenience. Nävî is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (with a usb mic/speakers).</code>

Nävî is a custom, Raspberry Pi–based AI assistant crafted for personal use and convenience. By leveraging voice activation (“Hey Nävî”), it captures audio input, converts it to text, and processes requests through a GPT-based model to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. Results are then relayed back through text-to-speech creating a fully integrated voice assistant solution.

Beyond basic voice interactions, Nävî's extensible growing architecture supports advanced use cases including:

    Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection (IDS) for home networks
    Ad/Tracker-blocking for entire network 
    Camera-based security integration
    Utilize Watchdog to protect and organize my files 
    IoT device management and control

A 5×7” screen can be connected to the Raspberry Pi to display custom images, animations, or other dynamic content based on user interactions. As the project evolves, new features and capabilities will be integrated to further enhance functionality and user experience.

This repository provides an overview of the software stack, including:

    Speech Recognition for hotword detection and input capture

    Natural Language Processing leveraging GPT-based models

    Text-to-Speech output (using different libs)

    Future Enhancements for camera feeds, network insights, and IoT integration

Contributions and suggestions are welcome, though the project is primarily tailored for a highly customized personal environment. For questions or improvements, please submit an issue or open a pull request. ☝️❤️
