# Nävî :: In The Cloud

<code>Nävî ITC is version 2 of my personal assistant (Omni) built soley for my own use and convenience. Nävî was originally designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (with a usb mic/speakers). Navi 2.0 (ITC) is primarily developed using many different AWS services. </code>

NäVî is a swiss army knife of tools and functionality:

    A friendly, capable, intelligent, and charming chatbot.
    Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection (IDS) for home network.
    Ad/Tracker-blocking via PiHole for entire network.
    Camera-based security integration.
    Utilize Watchdog to protect and organize my files.
    IoT device management and control.

A 5×7” screen is connected to the Raspberry Pi to display custom images, animations, or other dynamic content based on user interactions. As the project evolves, new features and capabilities will be integrated to further enhance functionality and user experience.

This repository provides files for developing locally and deploying in AWS server
